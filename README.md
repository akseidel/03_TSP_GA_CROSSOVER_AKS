This program develops solutions to the "Traveling Salesperson Problem" (TSP) using a genetic algorithm (GA) method. In the TSP there is a given set of "cities". The task is to find the shortest travel distance routing where the salesperson visits each city once, eventually returning to the starting city. The GA method maintains a population of routings that are initially chosen at random but then subsequently evolved from previous "better fitting" routings into newer populations using methods to emulate simple "genetic" reproduction while also introducing random changes.

The GA reproduction method in this program is crude compared to real life, but in its operation it does exhibit some fundamental evolution fundamentals. This program is designed for someone to observe how the simple GA evolution proceeds in context with the TSP complexity, mutation rate and genetic population size so that they can recognize some fundamental evolution concepts.
