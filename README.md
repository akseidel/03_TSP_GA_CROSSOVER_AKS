This program develops solutions to the "Traveling Salesperson Problem" (TSP) using a genetic algorithm (GA) method. In the TSP there is a given set of "cities". The task is to find the shortest travel distance routing where the salesperson visits each city once, eventually returning to the starting city. The GA method maintains a population of routings that are initially chosen at random but then subsequently evolved from previous "better fitting" routings into newer populations using methods to emulate simple "genetic" reproduction.
